# tour-finder
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Tour Finder project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo), following the practice of "Watch and then Do". 

### Overview and learnings
Tour Finder is a simple app that recommends tours.

The main React functionalities I learned are data fetching from external API, prop drilling, adding a loading page and a refresh feature.
I made my own setup, styling and for future development I will add a filter system to search for a certain price or amount of days among the tours fetched.
