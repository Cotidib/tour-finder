# tour-finder
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Tours project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and learnings
Tour Finder is a simple app that recommends tours with a simple filter system to search by a certain price range or an amount of days.

The main React functionalities I learned are data fetching from external API, prop drilling, adding a loading page, refresh and a "read more" functionality. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra feature to the original idea of the project.
